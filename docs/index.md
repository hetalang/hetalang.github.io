## Empowering Modelers in Pharmacology and Systems Biology

The **Heta Project** is an open-source initiative dedicated to transforming the landscape of pharmacology and systems biology modeling. By developing a unified infrastructure and best practices, we empower researchers and practitioners to create dynamic quantitative models with ease and efficiency.

---

## Why Heta?

- **Unified Data Structures:** Store model components, datasets, and tasks in a consistent format.
- **Domain-Specific Language:** Utilize the [Heta language](/specifications/), a DSL tailored for dynamic quantitative models.
- **Open-Source Tools and Resources:** Access [tools](ecosystem?id=Heta-supporting-tools), [examples](ecosystem?id=Open-source-QSP-platforms), and [study materials](resources/).
- **Best Practices and Workflows:** Follow established methodologies for efficient model development.
