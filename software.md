# Recommended software

Currently the easiest way to start working Heta-based platforms is to install "heta-compiler".

Usage of Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is optional but helps a lot.
This is a list of possible configurations tested for middle- and large-scale QSP platforms.

## Recommended

- **VSCode** <https://code.visualstudio.com/> + heta-highlight-vscode plugin + "Dark+" theme
- **Git** <https://git-scm.com/> (optional but provides bash console and Git synchronization)
- **Node** >=14 <https://nodejs.org/en/> 
- **heta-compiler** <https://hetalang.github.io/#/heta-compiler/?id=installation>
- **HetaSimulator** <https://hetalang.github.io/#/HetaSimulator.jl/>

## Alternative

User can also choose **Sublime Text** instead of VSCode <https://www.sublimetext.com/3>.
The Heta highlighter is also available as a plugin, use `Package Control: Install Package` and `Heta`.
