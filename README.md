**Heta Project** is an initiative aimed at developing infrastructure for modeling in pharmacology and systems biology. This project compiles best practices and our experience in dynamic system modeling, including systems biology, PK/PD, QSP, and the application of software development techniques in modeling routines.

As an open project, the results are accessible to everyone, and contributions are warmly welcomed. For more details on how you can contribute, please visit the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

The project currently focuses on the following areas:

- Developing unified data structures to store model components, datasets, and typical model tasks, as well as transforming models and tasks into various modeling formats.

- [Heta language](/specifications/), a domain-specific programming language (DSL) for dynamic quantitative models used in pharmacology and systems biology.

- Supporting QSP/SB Open Source development by providing [tools](implemented?id=Heta-supporting-tools), [examples](implemented?id=Open-source-QSP-platforms) and [study materials](resources/).

- Formulating best practices and elaborating workflows for model development.

## How to start

- Begin with the [Heta tutorial](https://hetalang.github.io/#/resources/?id=heta-tutorial).
- Experiment with the [Heta compiler online](https://heta-online.insysbio.com/).
- Explore [Heta code](https://hetalang.github.io/#/specifications/cases) examples and the [cheatsheet](https://hetalang.github.io/heta-cheatsheet.pdf).
- Learn more about [Specifications](https://hetalang.github.io/#/specifications/), [Heta compiler](https://hetalang.github.io/#/heta-compiler/) and [HetaSimulator.jl](https://hetalang.github.io/#/heta-simulator/).
