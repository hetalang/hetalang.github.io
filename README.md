**Heta project** is an initiative for the development of infrastructure for modeling in pharmacology and systems biology. The project also summarizes our experience in modeling of dynamical systems: systems biology, PK/PD, QSP as well as best practices of software development.

This is an open project which means the result will be available for everyone and any contribution is welcomed. For more details how you can help is on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

The project is currently focused on the following areas:

- The development of the unified data structures storing model parts, datasets and typical model tasks. Transformation of models and tasks to different modeling formats.
- [Heta language](/specifications/) which is a domain specific programming language for dynamic quantitative models used in pharmacology and systems biology.
- The development and support of QSP/SB **Open Source** development by providing [tools](implemented?id=Heta-supporting-tools), [examples](implemented?id=Open-source-QSP-platforms) and study materials.
- The formulation of best practices and elaboration of workflows for model development.
