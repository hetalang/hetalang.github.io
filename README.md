**Heta project** is an initiative for the development of infrastructure for modeling in pharmacology and systems biology. The project also summarizes best practices and our experience in modeling of dynamical systems: systems biology, PK/PD, QSP as well as implementation of software development techniques in modeling routine.

This is an open project which means the result will be available for everyone and any contribution is welcomed. For more details how you can help is on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

The project is currently focused on the following areas:

- The development of the unified data structures storing model parts, datasets and typical model tasks. Transformation of models and tasks to different modeling formats.
- [Heta language](/specifications/) which is a domain specific programming language (DSL) for dynamic quantitative models used in pharmacology and systems biology.
- The development and support of QSP/SB **Open Source** development by providing [tools](implemented?id=Heta-supporting-tools), [examples](implemented?id=Open-source-QSP-platforms) and [study materials](resources/).
- The formulation of best practices and elaboration of workflows for model development.

## How to start

- Study [Heta tutorial](https://hetalang.github.io/#/resources/?id=heta-tutorial).
- See [Heta code](https://hetalang.github.io/#/specifications/cases) examples and the [cheatsheet](https://hetalang.github.io/heta-cheatsheet.pdf).
- Read more about [Specifications](https://hetalang.github.io/#/specifications/), [Heta compiler](https://hetalang.github.io/#/heta-compiler/) and [HetaSimulator.jl](https://hetalang.github.io/#/heta-simulator/).
