**Heta language** is a domain specific programming language (not general-purpose) for dynamic quantitative models used in quantitative systems pharmacology and systems biology.

## Current state and implementation
Currently the standard is published on Github-pages <https://hetalang.github.io/>

A series of tools supporting Heta language has been developed:
- Syntax highlighting VSCode: [heta-highlight-vscode](https://github.com/insysbio/heta-highlight-vscode) (published on GitHub )
- Syntax highlighting Atom editor: [heta-highlight-atom](https://github.com/insysbio/heta-highlight-atom) (published on GitHub)
- JavaScript framework with Heta support has been developed and tested: qs3p-js v0.4 (will be published soon)

The examples of Heta-based QSP platforms with CI/CD capabilitiew are shared on gitlab: 
- <https://github.com/insysbio/heta-case-mini> 
- <https://github.com/insysbio/faah-inhibitor>

The Heta language and Heta-based QSP framework were used in several “real world” projects for the development of middle-scale and large-scale models:
-	IRT database: <https://irt.insysbio.com> 
-	Alzheimer-consortium QSP platform
-	PK/RO simulator for anti-PD-1 mAbs (Shiny app): <https://insysbio.shinyapps.io/mAb-app/>
-	InSysBio internal projects with more than 1000 components each.
