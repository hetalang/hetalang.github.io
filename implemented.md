# Implemented

## Open source QSP platforms

The examples of Heta-based QSP platforms with CI/CD capabilities are shared on GitHub.

- [heta-case-mini](https://github.com/insysbio/heta-case-mini/)
    A demo example of QSP platfrom developed with Heta and qs3p-js.
- [FAAH inhibitor model](https://github.com/insysbio/faah-inhibitor)
    A platform describing Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase inhibition in human.

## QSP projects

The Heta language and Heta-based QSP framework were used in several “real world” projects for the development of middle-scale and large-scale models:
-  [Alzheimer-consortium QSP platform](http://insysbio.com/en/news/20180910)
-  A set of InSysBio internal projects with more than 1000 components each.
