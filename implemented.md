## QSP projects

The Heta language and Heta-based QSP framework were used in several “real world” projects for the development of middle-scale and large-scale models.

## Heta supporting tools

- Julia package for simulation of large scale QSP models supporting Heta syntax: [HetaSimulator.jl](https://github.com/hetalang/HetaSimulator.jl) [![version](https://juliahub.com/docs/HetaSimulator/version.svg)](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/HetaSimulator/IIE0h)
- JavaScript framework and command line tool supporting Heta modules: [heta-compiler](https://github.com/hetalang/heta-compiler) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/heta-compiler)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heta-compiler)
- Syntax highlighting for VSCode: [heta-highlight-vscode](https://github.com/hetalang/heta-highlight-vscode) [![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/insysbio.heta-highlight-vscode?label=VSMarket)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=insysbio.heta-highlight-vscode)
- Syntax highlighting for Sublime text: [heta-highlight-sublime](https://github.com/hetalang/heta-highlight-sublime) [![GitHub tag (with filter)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/hetalang/heta-highlight-sublime)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/heta)
- Parsing of Heta language code in JavaScript: [heta-parser](https://github.com/hetalang/heta-parser) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/heta-parser)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heta-parser)

## Web applications

Heta syntax and Heta infrastructure were utilized for the development of web-based tools.

- [Heta compiler online](https://heta-online.insysbio.com/)
    Web based compiler and editor of Heta code.
- [SbmlViewer](https://sv.insysbio.com/)
    A tool for fast and easy reading of biological models written in SBML format. It allows you to open SBML in any browser.
- [Immune Response Template](https://irt.insysbio.com)
    A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) platform of immune system and tool for development of QSP and mechanistic models related to immune response.
- [mAb-app](https://shiny.insysbio.com/mAb-app/)
    PK/RO simulator for anti-PD-1 monoclonal Antibodies (Shiny app)
- [ery](https://shiny.insysbio.com/ery/)
    PK/PD simulator for Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (Shiny app)
- [sbml-mrgsolve-case](https://shiny.insysbio.com/sbml-mrgsolve-case/)
